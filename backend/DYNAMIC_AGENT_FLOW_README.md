# 🎯 Dynamic Agent Flow Architecture

## 🚀 Overview

The **Dynamic Agent Flow Architecture** revolutionizes query processing by implementing intelligent routing that selects only the necessary agents for each query type. This eliminates unnecessary processing and provides optimal response times based on query complexity.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### **1. Query Classification System**
The architecture starts with a **Query Classifier Agent** that determines:
- **Query Type**: What the user is asking for
- **Complexity Level**: Simple, medium, or complex
- **Required Agents**: Only the agents needed for this specific query

### **2. Flexible Flow Patterns**

#### ⚡ **Simple Queries (1-3 agents): ~2-3 seconds**
```
Query Classifier → Product Search → Response Generator
Query Classifier → Promotion Finder → Response Generator
Query Classifier → Store Navigator → Response Generator
```

#### 🎯 **Medium Queries (2-4 agents): ~3-4 seconds**
```
Query Classifier → Product Search → Substitution Finder → Response Generator
Query Classifier → Preference Memory → Recommendation Engine → Response Generator
```

#### 🍽️ **Complex Queries (Full pipeline): ~8-10 seconds**
```
Query Classifier → Intent Capture → Preference Memory → Meal Planner → Basket Builder → Response Generator
```

## 📋 Query Type Examples & Flows

### **1. Price Inquiry: "How much does milk cost?"**
- **Flow**: Query Classifier → Product Search → Price Lookup → Response Generator
- **Agents**: 3 total
- **Time**: ~2 seconds
- **Response**: "Organic milk is $4.99 per gallon and is in stock."

### **2. Low-carb Snacks: "What low-carb snacks do you have?"**
- **Flow**: Query Classifier → Product Search → Dietary Filter → Response Generator
- **Agents**: 3 total
- **Time**: ~3 seconds
- **Response**: "Here are some great low-carb options: [list of products]"

### **3. Substitution Request: "I need substitute for eggs"**
- **Flow**: Query Classifier → Product Search → Stock Checker → Substitution Finder → Response Generator
- **Agents**: 4 total
- **Time**: ~4 seconds
- **Response**: "Here are some great substitutes for eggs: applesauce, mashed banana, flax eggs"

### **4. Store Navigation: "Where can I find bread?"**
- **Flow**: Query Classifier → Product Search → Store Navigator → Response Generator
- **Agents**: 3 total
- **Time**: ~2 seconds
- **Response**: "You can find bread in Aisle 12 - Bakery Section."

### **5. Full Meal Planning: "Plan 5 meals under $60"**
- **Flow**: Query Classifier → Intent Capture → Preference Memory → Meal Planner → Basket Builder → Response Generator
- **Agents**: 6 total
- **Time**: ~8-10 seconds
- **Response**: "I've created a 5-meal plan within your $60 budget..."

## 🔧 Implementation Components

### **Core Agents**

#### **1. Query Classifier Agent** (`query_classifier_agent.py`)
```python
class QueryClassifierAgent:
    """
    Central routing component that determines:
    - Query Type (price_inquiry, substitution_request, meal_planning, etc.)
    - Complexity Level (simple, medium, complex)
    - Required Agents (only necessary ones)
    """
```

#### **2. Product Search Agent** (`product_search_agent.py`)
```python
class ProductSearchAgent:
    """
    Handles finding products based on user queries
    - Keyword extraction and matching
    - Dietary preference filtering
    - Relevance ranking
    """
```

#### **3. Dynamic Flow Orchestrator** (`dynamic_flow_orchestrator.py`)
```python
class DynamicFlowOrchestrator:
    """
    Executes appropriate flow patterns based on classification
    - Simple flow execution (1-3 agents)
    - Medium flow execution (2-4 agents)
    - Complex flow execution (6+ agents)
    """
```
