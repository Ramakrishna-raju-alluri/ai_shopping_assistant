# 🧠 Smart Agent Routing System

## 🚀 Overview

The new **Smart Routing System** revolutionizes query processing by dynamically selecting only the necessary agents for each query type. This eliminates unnecessary processing and provides **faster, more efficient responses**.

## ❌ Old Problems vs ✅ New Solutions

### **Before: Rigid Pipeline**
```
Every "goal-based" query → ALL agents (even unnecessary ones)
"What's the price of milk?" → Intent + Preference + Meal Planning + Basket + Stock + Feedback
⏱️ Result: 6-8 seconds for a simple price check
```

### **After: Smart Routing**
```
Query-specific agent selection
"What's the price of milk?" → General Query Agent only
⏱️ Result: < 2 seconds with precise answer
```

## 🎯 Query Categories & Routing

### **1. 💰 Price Check Queries**
```
Examples: "What's the price of milk?", "How much does bread cost?"
Agents Used: [General Query] only
Response Time: < 2 seconds
Skip Confirmation: ✅ Yes
```

### **2. 📦 Availability Check Queries**
```
Examples: "Do you have almond milk?", "Is Greek yogurt in stock?"
Agents Used: [General Query] only  
Response Time: < 2 seconds
Skip Confirmation: ✅ Yes
```

### **3. 🏪 Store Information Queries**
```
Examples: "What are your hours?", "Do you offer delivery?"
Agents Used: [General Query] only
Response Time: < 2 seconds  
Skip Confirmation: ✅ Yes
```

### **4. 🥗 Product Recommendation Queries**
```
Examples: "Suggest low-carb snacks", "Recommend high-protein foods"
Agents Used: [Intent, Preference, Product Recommender, Feedback]
Response Time: 3-5 seconds
Skip Confirmation: ❌ No (personalization needed)
```

### **5. 🔄 Substitution Requests**
```
Examples: "What can I substitute for eggs?", "Alternative to almond milk?"
Agents Used: [General Query, Stock Checker]
Response Time: 2-3 seconds
Skip Confirmation: ✅ Yes
```

### **6. 💸 Discount/Promotion Queries**
```
Examples: "What items are on sale?", "Show me current promotions"
Agents Used: [Stock Checker] only
Response Time: < 2 seconds
Skip Confirmation: ✅ Yes
```

### **7. 🍽️ Meal Planning Queries**
```
Examples: "Plan 3 meals under $30", "Create a weekly meal plan"
Agents Used: [Intent, Preference, Meal Planner, Basket Builder, Stock Checker, Feedback]
Response Time: 5-8 seconds
Skip Confirmation: ❌ No (complex personalization)
```

## 📊 Performance Improvements

| Query Type | Old Time | New Time | Improvement | Agents Saved |
|------------|----------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Price Check | 6-8s | <2s | **75% faster** | 5 agents |
| Availability | 6-8s | <2s | **75% faster** | 5 agents |
| Store Info | 6-8s | <2s | **75% faster** | 5 agents |
| Discounts | 6-8s | <2s | **75% faster** | 5 agents |

## 🚀 API Usage

### **New Smart Chat Endpoint**
```http
POST /api/v1/smart-chat
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "message": "What's the price of organic milk?",
  "session_id": "optional_session_id"
}
```

### **Response Format**
```json
{
  "session_id": "user_123_1699123456",
  "message": "What's the price of organic milk?",
  "query_category": "price_check",
  "execution_plan": {
    "category": "price_check",
    "required_agents": ["general_query"],
    "skip_confirmation": true,
    "response_template": "Here's the pricing information you requested:",

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Smart Router Components**

1. **`classify_query_category()`** - Analyzes message to determine category
2. **`get_required_agents()`** - Maps categories to necessary agents
3. **`should_skip_confirmation()`** - Determines if confirmation is needed
4. **`create_execution_plan()`** - Creates complete execution strategy

### **Flexible LangGraph**

- **Conditional Node Execution** - Agents only run if required
- **Dynamic Routing** - Flow adapts based on query category
- **Skip Logic** - Unnecessary agents are bypassed entirely
- **Response Compilation** - Builds appropriate response from executed agents

## 🧪 Testing & Analysis Tools

### **1. Query Analysis (No Execution)**
```http
POST /api/v1/analyze-query
{
  "message": "Suggest low-carb snacks"
}
```

### **2. Routing Comparison**
```http
POST /api/v1/compare-routing
{
  "message": "What's the price of bread?"
}
```

### **3. Query Examples**
