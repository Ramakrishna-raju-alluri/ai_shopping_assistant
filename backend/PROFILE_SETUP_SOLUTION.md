# 🎯 Profile Setup Solution - Complete Implementation

## 📋 Problem Solved
The frontend was skipping the profile setup flow for new users, going directly to meal planning without collecting user preferences. This resulted in generic recommendations instead of personalized ones.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 🔧 Backend Changes

#### 1. **New Profile Setup Module** (`backend/routes/profile_setup.py`)
- **Complete profile setup flow** with 5 steps:
  - 🥗 Dietary Preferences (diet, allergies, restrictions)
  - 🍽️ Cuisine Preferences (preferred/disliked cuisines)
  - 👨‍🍳 Cooking Preferences (skill level, time preference, equipment)
  - 💰 Budget Preferences (monthly budget, per-meal budget, shopping frequency)
  - 🎯 Meal Planning Goal

#### 2. **API Endpoints Created**
```
GET  /api/v1/profile-setup/status          - Check profile completion status
GET  /api/v1/profile-setup/options         - Get available setup options
POST /api/v1/profile-setup/complete        - Complete full profile setup
POST /api/v1/profile-setup/dietary         - Update dietary preferences
POST /api/v1/profile-setup/cuisine         - Update cuisine preferences
POST /api/v1/profile-setup/cooking         - Update cooking preferences
POST /api/v1/profile-setup/budget          - Update budget preferences
GET  /api/v1/profile-setup/user-preferences - Get user preferences for meal planning
```

#### 3. **DynamoDB Compatibility**
- Fixed float type issues by converting to Decimal types
- Proper data type handling for DynamoDB storage

#### 4. **Updated Main App** (`backend/main.py`)
- Added profile_setup router to FastAPI app
- Integrated with existing authentication system

### 🎨 Frontend Changes

#### 1. **Profile Setup Component** (`frontend/src/components/profile/ProfileSetup.tsx`)
- **5-step guided setup process**
- **Interactive forms** with validation
- **Progress indicator** showing current step
- **Summary view** before completion
- **Responsive design** for mobile/desktop

#### 2. **Profile Setup Wrapper** (`frontend/src/components/profile/ProfileSetupWrapper.tsx`)
- **Automatic detection** of profile completion status
- **Conditional rendering** based on setup status
- **Seamless integration** with existing auth flow

#### 3. **Updated App Routing** (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)
- **New route**: `/profile-setup`
- **Automatic redirection** for new users
- **Protected routes** with authentication

#### 4. **Dashboard Integration** (`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`)
- **Profile setup notification** for incomplete profiles
- **Direct link** to profile setup
- **Dismissible alerts** for user convenience

#### 5. **Styling** (`frontend/src/components/profile/ProfileSetup.css`)
- **Modern UI design** with glass morphism
- **Smooth animations** and transitions
- **Mobile-responsive** layout
- **Accessibility features**
